# Develop a Cloud Functions Node.js application

This repository includes toolchain code to deploy a serverless Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) application that uses Node.js and IBM Cloud Functions. Cloud Functions supplies basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations in a serverless environment. These functions can be mapped to an API gateway and then integrated into an iOS app; for example, to enable persistence of data into a Cloudant NoSQL Database or any other NoSQL database.

## Included components

* [Continuous Delivery](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/continuous-delivery): Enable tool integrations that support your development, deployment, and operation tasks.
* [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/): GitLab unifies issues, code review, CI, and CD into a single UI.

## Featured technologies

* [IBM Cloud Functions](https://cloud.ibm.com/functions): An event-action platform that allows you to run code in response to an event.
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/): An open-source JavaScript runtime environment for running server-side JavaScript code.

## Steps

While you can use the individual actions locally, this collection of endpoints is meant to be deployed to IBM Cloud Functions. You can [deploy this application to IBM Cloud](#deploying-to-ibm-cloud) or [deploy it manually](#deploying-manually) by cloning this repo first.  

You can then review the [Actions](https://cloud.ibm.com/functions/actions) in the IBM Cloud console, along with your [Cloud Functions APIs](https://cloud.ibm.com/functions/apimanagement).

    </a>
</p>

Click **Create toolchain** to deploy this same application to IBM Cloud. This option creates a deployment pipeline, complete with a hosted GitLab project and DevOps toolchain. [IBM Cloud DevOps](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/devops) services provides toolchains as a set of tool integrations that support development and deployment to IBM Cloud Functions. 

### Deploying manually 

To deploy this application to IBM Cloud using the command line, you can leverage the IBM Cloud Developer Tools.

* Install [IBM Cloud Developer Tools](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started) on your machine by running the following command:
  ```
  curl -sL https://ibm.biz/idt-installer | bash
  ```
